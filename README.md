# Online-Credit-Assessment-Tool
Users input their income, expenses, and debt details via a form. The app calculates an affordable repayment plan based on these inputs.
# Ideal first step should be to input client ID and check client #credit bureau score if client has good credit score and rating. #For that, we should be linking to the credit bureau first.
